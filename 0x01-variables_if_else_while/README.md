0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

TASKS:

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

1. The last digit

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

TASKS:

Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

The program should return 0

1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


2. 10 x alphabet

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

3. islower

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.

4. isalpha

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

5. Sign

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.

7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Returns the value of the last digit

8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)

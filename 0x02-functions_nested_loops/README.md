TASKS:

Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

The program should return 0

1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


2. 10 x alphabet

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

3. islower

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.

4. isalpha

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

5. Sign

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.

7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Returns the value of the last digit

8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)

9. Learn your times table

Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void times_table(void);
Format: see example

10. a + b

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: int add(int, int);

11. 98 Battery Street, the OG

Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in order
The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
The last printed number should be 98
You are allowed to use the standard library

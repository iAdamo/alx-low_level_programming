0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

TASKS:

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isupper. Run man isupper to learn more.

1. isdigit

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise

2. Collaboration is multiplication

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

3. The numbers speak for themselves

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
